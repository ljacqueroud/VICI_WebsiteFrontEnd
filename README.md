# VICI_WebsiteFrontEnd

Repo for website creation for the Vici Project. Vici was created in the context of a three day hackaton and it's objective was to increase visibility and help smaller businesses during the Covid period.

The repo works in conjunction with the website backend, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Joh11/vici_backend).
